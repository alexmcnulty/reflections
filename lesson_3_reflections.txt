When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others so they also have access to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    May have made experimental changes that may be different to the remote version of the file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks clone the repository on github. Use when cloning a remote repository which can be linked back to orignial.
    Clones copy repository to remote. Used to work on remotely.
    Bracnhes adds a new path to a repository. Locally or remotely. Experimenting and testing with new features that may not be ready for development.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can see the difference between your own master branch and the last online commit, and can see the difference between the newest remote commit and yours.
